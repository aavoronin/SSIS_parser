# SSIS_Parser

## üìò Overview

`SSIS_Parser` is a Python tool that parses `.dtsx` files from SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) projects.
It extracts executable structures, components, SQL statements, and connections,
then exports the data to `.xlsx` Excel files for further inspection or documentation.

This parser is helpful for:
- Documenting SSIS packages
- Auditing or migrating data pipelines
- Reverse engineering data flows
